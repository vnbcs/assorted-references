# Learning Python Advice and Resources
## Installing Python
+ I recommend installing Python following Dr. Na-Rae Han’s instructions here: [Python 3 Notes](https://sites.pitt.edu/~naraehan/python3/) (for both Mac and Windows). 
+ [Command Line Python](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-python-on-windows-10/command-line-python): Specific advice for Windows users.
+ [How to Run Your Python Scripts](https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/): Different options for running Python code.
+ For beginners, I recommend running Python code using Python’s built in interpreter IDLE or command line. You can write Python scripts in any text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).

## Beginners
+ [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html): Free and open source textbook for beginners. I highly recommend going through the textbook in order and doing all the exercises.
+ [3.10.4 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): This is the Python docmentation. If you’re confused about any of base Python’s functions, come here first.
+ [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp): If you’re still confused after looking at the documentation, try W3.
+ [Getting Started - pip documentation v22.1.dev0](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/getting-started/): How to install Python packages using pip. 


## Bash resources
+ I know, this list is about Python, but command line skills are essential for all programmers in any language. 
+ [Basics of BASH for Beginners](https://towardsdatascience.com/basics-of-bash-for-beginners-92e53a4c117a)
+ [The Bash Guide](https://guide.bash.academy/)

## Intermediate
+ Now that you have basic Python skills, consider installing a Python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), which includes lots of useful packages for data science and statistics.
+ You might also want to switch from your default editor to one specifically for writing code. Check out your options here: [Text Editors and IDEs](https://www.fullstackpython.com/text-editors-ides.html). 
+ Also install Git - [Git - Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). This will allow you to use GitHub.
+ [Data Structures and Information Retrieval in Python](https://allendowney.github.io/DSIRP/): Free and open-source textbook.
+ [Think Stats](https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/index.html): Free and open-source textbook about running statistics analyses in Python. If you want to use Python in an academic setting, this is very useful. 
+ [Python Data Science Handbook | Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html): Free and open-source textbook. This is the textbook I used in my Data Science class. I still refer back to this all the time.
